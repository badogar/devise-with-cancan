This app is a test app to learn some basics of devise. This app is built by following the tutorial 
http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-bootstrap-devise-cancan.html therefore, all the credits goes to Daniel Kehoe.
This app demonstrate the cancan, devise, rolify, simple_form, fiagro, twitter-bootstrap etc (and many more cool gems)

The only difference between the tutorial app and mine is the database used. I am using the mysql rather than sqlite3.
